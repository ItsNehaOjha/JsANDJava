    //  closure 
/*    a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. 
    In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created,
    at function creation time.
    Functions in JavaScript form closures. A closure is the combination of a 
    function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
    This environment consists of any variables that were in-scope at the time 
    the closure was created.

//ONE MORE METHOD TO CREATE FUNCTIONS AS A EXPRESSION

//normal way

}
addOne(4)

//expreesion methos :-

const addTwo = function(num){
    return num+2
}
addTwo(5)

// ----------------------HOISTING ----------------------


console.log(addOneH(4))  // this will not give error and give o/p = 5

//Function declarations here are hoisted entirely.

function addOneH(num){
    return num +1
}

//expreesion methos :-

addTwoH(5)    // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'addTwoH' before initialization


const addTwoH = function(num){  //Only the variable addTwoH is hoisted, not the function itself.
    return num+2
}
//At the time addTwoH(5) is executed, addTwoH is still uninitialized.

//                      note :- 
/*

Function Expression (const or let): üö´ Only variable hoisted, not the function: Can not be used before declaration?
